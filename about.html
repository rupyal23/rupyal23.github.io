				<h2>Something About Me</h2>
				<p>My name is Kanwarjit S Rupyal. I am from Buffalo, NY. I was born in Punjab, India. I immigrated to the USA in 2014. I have two boys, they are my life. </p>
				<p>I want to become a software developer. Currently I am a student at devCodeCamp. devCodeCamp is a coding boot camp based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. They provide a very unique learning process. It is fast paced but effective as well. So far I have learned to code and design webpages using HTML and CSS.</p>
				<p>I am extremely excited about learning new computer languages and what would I be able to do with them. I have made some basic javascript programs. You can check them under my Portfolio page.</p>
				<p>Besides this, I love to play games on PC and on PS4. I also love to go on long drives particularly around countryside sometimes, far from big cities.</p>
